# FontCvtTool - A program to convert FontCvt's output into files usable with GraphLCD

## What is this used for?

This program takes the output file from Segger's FontCvt (the old version from 2013), removes the fluff, 
and converts it into the simple, somewhat compressed format required for legacy and new versions of GraphLCD
